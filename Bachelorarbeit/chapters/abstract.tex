    In this thesis, we introduce an approach to enhance neural networks by mutating neurons identified through spectrum-based fault localization.
    This method, initially demonstrated in DeepFault, is advanced by mutating weights and biases based on suspiciousness values.
    The thesis introduces an automated mutation algorithm, and evaluates the approach using the Fashion-MNIST dataset across various model architectures and training dataset sizes.
    Results show notable accuracy improvements and provide insights into the impact of suspiciousness measures, dataset sizes, and initial training extents.
    This research contributes to the field by offering a refined technique for neural network accuracy enhancement and opens avenues for future exploration in neural network fault localization and repair strategies.
