    \item Could the mutation of faulty neurons improve the quality and reliability of a Deep Neural Network?
    \item Could the mutation of faulty neurons during training improve the quality and reliability of a Deep Neural Network?
    \item Which mutations are the most promising for improvement?
    \item Which combinations of mutations are the most promising?
    \item Which suspiciousness measure is the most promising for improving a Deep Neural Network?
    \item Are the suspiciousness measures more accurate than random choosing?

\section{Experiment Setup}\label{sec:experiment-setup}
We evaluated our approach on a Workstation consisting of an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor 4,6 GHz, with 32 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070Ti GPU with 12 GB of VRAM and 7680 CUDA Cores.
The setup is running Ubuntu release 22.04, running with Windows Subsystem for Linux, on Microsoft Windows 11 Pro, we use it because since version 2.11\cite{noauthor_build_2023} TensorFlow doesn't support GPU acceleration natively any more.
Regarding the Software, we are using Python version 3.10.12 and using TensorFlow version 2.14.1, with CUDA version 12.3.
