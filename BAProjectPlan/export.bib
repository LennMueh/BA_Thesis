	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications including autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. To reduce the residual risk for unexpected {DNN} behaviour and provide evidence for their trustworthy operation, {DNNs} should be thoroughly tested. The {DeepFault} whitebox {DNN} testing approach presented in our paper addresses this challenge by employing suspiciousness measures inspired by fault localization to establish the hit spectrum of neurons and identify suspicious neurons whose weights have not been calibrated correctly and thus are considered responsible for inadequate {DNN} performance. {DeepFault} also uses a suspiciousness-guided algorithm to synthesize new inputs, from correctly classified inputs, that increase the activation values of suspicious neurons. Our empirical evaluation on several {DNN} instances trained on {MNIST} and {CIFAR}-10 datasets shows that {DeepFault} is effective in identifying suspicious neurons. Also, the inputs synthesized by {DeepFault} closely resemble the original inputs, exercise the identified suspicious neurons and are highly adversarial.},

	abstract = {We present Fashion-{MNIST}, a new dataset comprising of 28x28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images and the test set has 10,000 images. Fashion-{MNIST} is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original {MNIST} dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size, data format and the structure of training and testing splits. The dataset is freely available at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist},
